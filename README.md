# Introduction to Advanced Class Methods

We've learned about building complex class objects, the `self` keyword, and class
variables and methods. We'll continue to expand on building out classes by
introducing these concepts:

- Building custom class constructors
- Building class finders
- Build class operators
- Implementing a class method which creates instances of its own class
- Using class variables to keep track of data pertaining to a class

In this section, we'll be focusing on building out more complex object-oriented
Ruby programs that combine the concepts we've discussed thus far.
